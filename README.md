Build your portfolio project (Week 2): MVP Complete

In the context of software development and the concept of Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the term "repository" typically refers to a version control repository where the source code of the software project is stored and managed. Commonly, developers use version control systems like Git to maintain a repository.

Here's a brief overview of how a typical MVP's repository might be structured:

Project Structure:

The repository would contain the entire codebase of the software project.
It may include subdirectories for different components or modules of the application.
Source Code:

The actual source code files for the application, written in programming languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.
Version Control:

The repository would leverage a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes, branches, and revisions.
Commits and commit messages would document changes made to the codebase over time.
Documentation:

README files or other documentation to guide developers on setting up and running the project.
Documentation might also include information on how to contribute to the project.
Dependencies:

A file (e.g., requirements.txt in Python projects) listing all dependencies and their versions needed to run the application.
Build and Deployment Scripts:

Scripts or configuration files for building and deploying the application.
This could include tools like Docker for containerization.
Tests:

A directory for testing scripts or frameworks, ensuring the reliability of the code.
Issue Tracking:

Integration with an issue tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues) to manage and prioritize tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
Continuous Integration (CI) Configuration:

Configuration files for CI tools (e.g., Travis CI, Jenkins) to automate testing and deployment processes.
Branches:

Different branches for development, testing, and potentially a production-ready branch.
Remember, the specifics can vary based on the technology stack, development practices, and team preferences. Using platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for hosting and managing repositories is common, providing collaboration features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.
